Content: I'm excited to announce that Willow (YC X25) has raised $4.2 million to build voice-first interfaces. 

We started Willow after dropping out of Stanford freshman year to build a healthcare startup. It failed. We pivoted over 10 times, spent a year in the trenches, and learned how to build the hard way.

But we discovered something huge.

Voice scribes were giving doctors their lives back. They were able to focus on helping patients rather than wasting nights and weekends on paperwork.

That's when it hit us. If voice could transform healthcare, why not every knowledge worker? Why are a billion professionals still hammering away at keyboards to communicate with humans (email, Slack, writing) and AI (ChatGPT, Cursor)?

Today, thousands of professionals at companies like Canva, GitHub, and Webflow use Willow to work 5x faster.

We're building Willow to unlock voice as the universal interface where you can control any device, any app, any workflow simply by speaking.

And most importantly, thank you to the best co-founder and CTO Lawrence Liu.

We're hiring for founding engineer, designer, and ML roles who want to redefine how humans work. 

Join a world-class team building technology that transforms lives daily with top-tier compensation and equity.

Comment "Join Willow" if you want to be fast-tracked.

The next decade will be defined by voice-first computing. The question isn't whether this transformation will happen. It's whether you'll be part of building it.
